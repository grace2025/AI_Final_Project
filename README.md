# AI_Final_Project: Finding the Best Genre Prediction Model
### Anna Birge, Grace Bhagat, Zach Paquette, Hannah Storrer


### Objective: Implement different classifiers to predict a song's genre and compare performances of each classifier

 #### Classifiers: 
  - Neural Network
  - Naive Bayes
  - SVMs
  - *TBD*

Neural Networks Classifier and the Naive Bayes Classifier are implemented from scratch. SVMs Classifier will use the sklearn model. 

## TO DO
- Research the 4th classifier (if we want to take on another one) ... Gradient Boosting?
- Split up how we want to divide the work -- 1 person each model?
- Determine standardized performance metrics to measure for each model
- Add findings to the presentation
- ... ?
