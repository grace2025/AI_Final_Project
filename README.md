# AI_Final_Project: Finding the Best Genre Prediction Model
### Anna Birge, Grace Bhagat, Zach Paquette, Hannah Storrer


## Objective: Implement different classifiers to predict a song's genre and compare performances of each classifier

 #### Classifiers: 
  - Neural Network
  - Naive Bayes
  - SVM

Neural Networks Classifier and the Naive Bayes Classifier are implemented from scratch. SVMs Classifier will use the sklearn model. 


## *Delete below sections in final README*
 ### README Instructions:
  - All repositories must also include a detailed Read-Me file with instructions to recreate an appropriate environment and any necessary packages, and a walkthrough on how to run your code. Jupyter notebooks are not an acceptable submission format for the final project, but may be used solely for any data cleaning and preprocessing steps. If so, include the notebook and detailed documentation for the user in your GitHub repository.


### TO DO
- Determine standardized performance metrics to measure for each model
- Add findings to the presentation
- ... ?
